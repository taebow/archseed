# Wireplumber Audio Configuration for Zephyrus G14

This configuration replaces the original `update_pcm.sh` solution, which is no longer working reliably on newer machines. The wireplumber config provides a stable base for audio management.

Place this configuration in `~/.config/wireplumber/` for it to take effect.
